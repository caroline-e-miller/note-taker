# note-taker

## Description

Note-Taker is an application designed to allow users to create, save, and edit notes. Its functionality is versatile and can be used for reminders, to-do lists, and general notes.

## Usage

The user will be presented with a home page that has a button which links to the note-taking page. Once there, the user will find two empty fields: one on the right for the title and the note body, and one empty column on the left for saved notes. After the user has entered text in both the title and body fields, a save button will appear in the upper right corner of the page. Once the note has saved, the user can click on the note in the left-hand column. It will appear on the right, where it can be viewed, edited, and re-saved by the user.
